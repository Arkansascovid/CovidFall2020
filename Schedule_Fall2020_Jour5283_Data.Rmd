**R and R Studio**       


<img src="Images/RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gradient.png" width="300" height="100" />
    
    Install R and R Studio.
    
    This is free and open source software. It is not large and doesn't tax the memory a lot. 
    R runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, but this course is designed for the Mac version. 
    If you use Windows, there may be variations in the lessons and instructions. Please see me      for questions.
    
    Installing R is a two-step process: 
    1) Install R, the actual program
    2) Install RStudio, a common interface 

    1) Download the most recent version of R for Mac:         
  https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/bin/macosx/R-4.0.2.pkg

    --If you have a Windows computer, go to: 
  https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.2-win.exe

    Accept all of the default settings for Mac.

     2) Install RStudio, the interface we use to manage and create R code. Download the open         source edition of R Studio desktop and follow the prompts to install it.   
   https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

## Wednesday, Aug. 26  

**Agenda**  
      
      Arkansascovid.com
      Intro to Tableau
      Teams
      IRE Conference  IRE20 Conference will be Sept. 21-25 
      Exercises and tutorial

**Same Goal, New Direction**
    
    Our partnership with Arkansascovid.com has changed.
    
    Misty Orpin has asked the Journalism Department to run the website. https://arkansascovid.com/
    
    I said yes.
    
    It's an incredible opportunity for the class and the School of Journalism.
    
    And here is how we will do it.
    
    --The School of Journalism will have a GA and a Graduate Intern dedicated to basic daily update of the site: home page data, key charts, a few key Tweets per day.
    
    --This class will write stories and produce data visualizations based on Arkansascovid.com data. That was our original goal. We will just be doing more and with different tools, primarily Tableau and then R, and in a different way.
    
    And we will be Tweeting and doing podcasts, so that will be new.
    
    Normally, I do not revise the course plan like this after the first day of class. But what an opportunity for all of us!
    
    You and the School of Journalism and Strategic Media will be running a multimedia data site and Twitter feed with 11,000 followers reporting on one of the most important issues facing society.
    
**What is New**   

      This course will emphasize Tableau for the next two months instead of R 
      We will shift to a more limited examination of R in October  
      Tableau is less complex than R   
      Homework assignments will involve Tweeting on the account   

**IRE Conference: Sept. 21-25**

      Fellowship: 
   https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/conferences/2020-ire-conference/ire20-fellowships-scholarships

**_________________________________________________________________________________________**

**Here's an update**

I made a lot of progress over the weekend figuring out the automation process to gather and crunch the daily numbers. I will discuss this in class but I want you all to check this short video before class tomorrow.

https://video.uark.edu/media/ADH+Data+Flow+to+Arkcovid/0_c6hn4feo


After looking at everything, I turned to R to streamline the data gathering and analysis process. So I will be teaching you guys the basic R in tandem with Tableau. They fit hand in hand. 

<img src="Images/ArkansasCovid.png" width="100" height="100" />


For this class, the grading be based on a combination of daily task work to keep the site running and a few assignments that highlight the data skills I want you to learn this semester.

- **Daily Tasks** 
            
            Some combination of these each week:   
             
            See link to Daily Tasks in Teams    
            Tweeting duties: 
               Prepare and monitor twitter for research requests, feedback, engagement.    
               Draft responses. Post in Teams     
            Data Visualizations   
            Data Maintenance for Site    
            Web design, posting   
            Shorter stories    
            Improvements   
            UATV or other media partnership / appearance 
            Work with another class
            Tasks TBD 
            
Each week you'll put a report of your activities in the "Daily Tasks" Assignment in Blackboard. Instructions are on that assignment.

The grading will be guided by this concept: Make meaningful contributions to the website each week. The term "meaningful contributions" is deliberately vague since we are in an evolving process. I don't want to set a floor for minimal behavior - I am going to push you pretty hard and want you to multitask effectively. I would view the grading like this: Someone will get less than an A if they don't communicate or flake out on an assignment. If you demonstrate to me that you are trying, we don't have a problem.



- **Assignments**

            There are still four in the semester but there will be more flexibility on when they are handed in and what the content will involve. The basic skills I want everyone to learn remain the same: 
            
            —Carefully reported enterprise stories   
            —Data Visualization in R, Tableau (or Flourish)   
            -R Data Analysis with a basic chart   
            —Major Data Maintenance, Restructuring for Site      
            
 
The R and Tableau instructional material will be delivered like before. I will count on you guys to work through the exercises and gain basic competency. 

Teams Has Two Standing Documents Posted for Daily Tasks and Story Pitches, which I will discuss below


- **Who Are We?**

    I have done a few media interviews since the announcement Thursday. First, the announcement was met by a great deal of enthusiasm in the community, among senior faculty and the like.   
    A few questions came up.   
    
    --Will we have the opinions that Misty offered in her Twitter feed? My response is Misty came to her opinions after some very in-depth reporting. My class is oriented towards the Associated Press style of reporting, hard news and analysis. Our posts will be rooted in-depth reporting that is transparent to the readers.     
    
    --How do we respond to people who ask us Covid-19 questions? If you have the answer and can supply the source, then reply, noting you are speaking for yourself. If you are in doubt, say you don't know and that you'll raise the issue for the class.   
    
    This should serve as a reminder that everyone in this class will be in a social media fishbowl. People may troll us and look in our social media feeds to find things to embarass the project. Keeping your personal social media feeds professional will be important. This is one thing all journalists need to acknowledge.  
    
    

- **Tasks To Do**

    See document in Teams
    Suggest a task here. put a comment on it and tag me. If I agree, I'll add it
    


- **Story Pitches**

    See document in Teams. If you have a story idea, even if it is not fully developed, put it here and the class can examine and discuss it.

**Ch 1 & 2 of Machlis: Key Points **  

    Reproducible research 
    Repetitive tasks in modern newsrooms.  Employment reports, crime stats, budgets
    Variables - an R object
    Assignment operator <-
    Case sensitive
    Vector: A vector can only have one type of data - all integers, all strings
    Dataframe - like a spreadsheet
    Save files - Don’t save workspace: because all of your variables will be stored and re-loaded the next time you launch RStudio. It’s too     easy to forget about previously stored variables that can interfere with later work,

    --The stacked bar plot provides the same information, but makes it easier to accurately determine at a glance how large each group is out of the whole.
    --This bar chart splits the categories horizontally, and draws attention to how the family members are ordered. It encourages the reader to think about the distribution rather than disconnected categories, and gives a better sense of sense of scale.
