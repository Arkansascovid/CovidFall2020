## Data and Lessons for Jour 5283, Fall 2020

Welcome to the GitHub site for Jour 5283, a graduate Data Journalism course at the School of Jounalism and Strategic Media at the University of Arkansas. 

The work on this site is designed to help graduate students explore and hone their data journalism skills. 

We are happy to share our work with the public but please understand this: *draft data and code will be posted here.*

You probably will be looking at a work in progress. **It may have omissions. It could have errors, despite our best efforts.**

If you plan to use any of this material for publication, research or citation, please first contact the instructor, Rob Wells, assistant professor, and ask if the files in question represent our latest and greatest work. Chances are, there's something better and cleaner in the works.  

Also, we welcome your suggestions and insights!

Wells can be reached at **rswells@uark.edu**

Thanks.
